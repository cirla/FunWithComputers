Fun With Computers is an anthology of [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) works that attempts to highlight the breadth and depth of amusement and utility that one can achieve with a bit of technomancy and a lot of curiosity.

All of the source for this website is [on GitHub](https://github.com/cirla/funwithcomputers/tree/gh-pages), so feel free
to use it as you wish. All I ask is that whatever you do with it, you have some fun doing it.
